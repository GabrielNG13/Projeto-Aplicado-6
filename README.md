# Projeto Aplicado à Engenharia de Computação V.I - SpaceInvaders

## About:
This repository contains the game developed for the Computer Engineering V.I. course. To develop the project, we were given the challenge of creating a web application using ONLY JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and using SOCKET.IO to create a connection between the server and the clients. So, we chose to recreate the Space Invaders game, the big hit of the 80's! The game is simple, consisting of a spaceship, controlled by the user, facing aliens in an invasion in a totally space thematic.

## How to play:
- First, download the .zip from this repository or clone it using Git, which should already be installed on your machine.
- Then open the file 'index.html', located in Pages/Initial_Page/index.html, and enjoy!

## Developers:
- Gabriel Nunes
